## :book: About Me      

***William Jones, willj836@gmail.com, 07379766090***

I am a passionate full-stack engineer with a deep passion for problem-solving. As a recent graduate of the Makers Academy bootcamp, I have honed my problem-solving skills and am capable of quickly adapting to new technologies and frameworks.

I am a logical thinker, skilled in collaboration, pair programming, and technical documentation. I value agile methodologies and enjoy working with teams that challenge me. My first-class degree in chemistry and experience in sales roles at Uber and Revolut have provided me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and enhanced my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Overall, I am confident that I have the skills and experience to make a valuable contribution to any team, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer.

## ðŸ¤” Skills

Quick learner - I have a talent for rapidly and efficiently acquiring new technologies and practices. During my time at Makers Academy, I eagerly tackled challenges such as creating a two-week final project in React-Native, despite having no prior experience in mobile development.

Analytical thinking - My background in chemistry has honed my problem-solving skills and given me a strong foundation in analytical thinking. These skills have proven highly transferable to software engineering, where I am able to apply my scientific knowledge to solve complex technical challenges.

Adaptability - I thrive in new and diverse environments, and I am unfazed by the prospect of learning new programming languages, working with new teams, or taking on unfamiliar challenges. I view every new experience as an opportunity for growth and development.

Curiosity - I am deeply passionate about learning and constantly strive to explore new areas of development and code craftsmanship. My time at Makers Academy has only reinforced my desire to broaden my knowledge and deepen my understanding of software engineering.

Enthusiasm - I am highly motivated and eager to take on challenges, even if they are difficult or time-consuming. I am not afraid to dive in and get my hands dirty in pursuit of a goal.

Team player - I am comfortable working as part of a team and am able to adapt to different roles, whether that means taking on leadership responsibilities or working collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal.

Commitment - I completed the three-month Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student, which required a great deal of self-discipline and focus. I am deeply committed to my work and take pride in seeing tasks through to completion.
