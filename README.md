## :book: About Me      

[probably change the format of this section to be more descriptive, why I decided to take the leap into software engineering, more on my background etc]

- üéì Graduated in 2021 with a degree in chemistry.
- üåÜ Decided I wanted to live in London so I got myself a job in sales at Uber.
- üôÖ I quite quickly discovered sales wasn't for me... I almost just as quickly discovered the world of software engineering and decided this **was** the world for me.
- üè¶ I moved into another sales role at Revolut to save up as quickly as I could (career changes are rather expensive).
- üíª As soon as I was able to, I left Revolut to start my software engineering journey with Makers!

## :computer: Work Experience

**Revolut** (July 2022 to November 2022)  
Account Executive

- I left Revolut rank 3/45 for my cohort in terms of performance

**Uber** (June 2021 to July 2022)  
Account Executive (6 months), Senior Account Executive (7 months)

locations.
- Consistently exceeded targets. Achieved 124% of my target in Q3 of 2021 and 126% of my target for Q4
of 2021. In Q1 2022 the restaurants I onboarded generated over ¬£250,000 in their first 28 days of trading,
generating ~¬£70,000 of revenue for Uber - this was the highest value in my team of 15.
