## :book: About Me      

***William Jones, willj836@gmail.com, 07379766090***

I am a passionate full-stack engineer with a deep passion for problem-solving. As a recent graduate of the Makers Academy bootcamp, I have honed my problem-solving skills and am capable of quickly adapting to new technologies and frameworks.

I am a logical thinker, skilled in collaboration, pair programming, and technical documentation. I value agile methodologies and enjoy working with teams that challenge me. My first-class degree in chemistry and experience in sales roles at Uber and Revolut have provided me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and enhanced my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Overall, I am confident that I have the skills and experience to make a valuable contribution to any team, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer.
